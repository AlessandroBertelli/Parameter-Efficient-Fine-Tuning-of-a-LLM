Hopsworks is an open-source platform for the development and operation of Machine Learning (ML) pipelines at scale.
It is best known for being the first open-source Feature Store for Machine Learning.
The Feature Store allows data scientists to store, update, and retrieve features for training and inference, ensuring consistency between training and serving.
Hopsworks follows the Lakehouse architecture, combining the best of data warehouses and data lakes.
You can connect to Hopsworks using Python, Scala, or Java.
The platform supports both batch inference and online (real-time) inference.
To connect to the Feature Store in Python, you typically use the 'hopsworks' library and call 'project.get_feature_store()'.
Hopsworks can be deployed on AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premise.
One co-founder of Hopsworks is Jim.
Jim is also the CEO.
